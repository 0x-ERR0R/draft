            <p>What is strength? 
                <br><br>
                How much you can lift, perhaps? But physical strength is weak in the narrative of time. It decays far too easily, and becomes nothing more than the dust beneath our feet, kicked up and left to float away with the slightest disturbance. No, it's a different kind of strength. There's a subtle melody that flows throughout you. It resonates and pools in your throat, forming into the sound of your very own voice. It flutters through the air and lands on those lucky enough to hear it. It's there, even when no words are spoken.
                <br><br>
                I've found a new kind of strength. A strength that's worth holding onto until I too am nothing more than dust.
                <br><br>
                A strength that is you.
